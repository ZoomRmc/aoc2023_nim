## General notes
What I'm trying to stick to while writing the solutions, in order of importance:
 - Intelligible implementation logic, clear data flow.
 - Brevity must not hurt readability.
 - Short functions with evident behaviour, hopefully as "strict" as reasonable.
 - Keep the solutions for both parts independent of each other. In other words, p2 has to be solvable from parsed input, not using state from p1.
 - Use more suitable/interesting data structures available. It's tempting to solve *everything* with Hash Tables, though with each year it gets harder to resist and be done with it all.
 - Explore standard library before jumping to external libs.

## Notes on specific days

### Day 3

<summary>Day 3 spoiler</summary>
One of the rare cases when using Maps (Tables) for working with grids makes more sense, due to general sparsity of the data.

### Day 2

Learning Nim pegs pays off, though I wouldn't call actually using them neither quick nor simple.

### Day 1
